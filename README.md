# EPFL thesis/project report Typst template

Same as [HexHive's template](https://github.com/HexHive/thesis_template), but in Typst, plus or minus some typography details.

## Documentation

The documentation of each function is available in the `documentation.pdf` file.

## Before using Typstâ€¦

Be aware that Typst is in a very early stage of development. I, personally, not recommend using Typst if:
- You are already familiar with LaTeX and you are happy with it.
- Any more complex bibliography stuff than a `bibliography.bib` file.
- You already have personal LaTeX macros.

However, I recommend using this template if:
- You are already familiar with Typst and its quirks.
- You want to give it a try, but you don't want to start from scratch.
- :warning: This template is -- very probably -- feature lacking compared to HexHive's template.

As a warning, with Typst, you can not:
- include `.pdf` graphics
- have floating figures
- TODO: find more limitations

## Official-ness of this template

I have no affiliation with EPFL nor HexHive. This template is not official in any way, but it is based on HexHive's template.

If you want to give it a try and have no rules about strictly using LaTeX nor the official template, feel free to use it and tweak-it to your liking!

## Tips

All the tips from HexHive's template are valid here too.
